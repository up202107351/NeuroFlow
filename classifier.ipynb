    "* Artifact Removal: Rely heavily on real-time filtering and thresholding. Applying pre-trained ICA is an option but less robust than offline.\n",
    "* Features: Band power (FFT/Welch) is standard. DWT/WPD is feasible but more costly. Entropy is feasible but potentially slow and needs careful implementation/testing and sufficiently long windows.\n",
    "* Computation: Be mindful of computational load and latency at every step. Choose methods that fit your hardware and latency requirements.\n",
    "* Workflow: Acquire window -> Filter -> Detect Artifacts -> (Optional Apply ICA) -> Extract Features -> Classify.\n",

    "The relaxed task had the subjects listening to low-tempo music and sound effects designed to aid in meditation whilst being instructed on relaxing their muscles and resting. For a neutral mental, a similar test was carried out, but with no stimulus at all, this test was carried out prior to any others to prevent lasting effects of a relaxed or concentrative mental state. Finally, for concentration, the subjects were instructed to follow the \"shell game\" in which a ball was hidden under one of three cups, which were then switched, the task was to try and follow which cup hid the ball.
